# The Project

## Wing

I purchased an RV-4 wing kit partially completed by an A&P for $1,000. 

## Fuselage

I purchased a very damaged RV-4 aiframe with an additional wing.  I may use the wing, but I will likely scrap it.

I bought the project because it has a _LOT_ of hardware that's expensive.  It has a canopy frame, and most ribs are probably usable.  I can use those longerons and ribs a template to rebuild this fuselage faster than building one from raw stock (the normal RV way).   So it's going to save me some time.

I can purchase the new skins from airparts inc for $900.

I got this airframe for basically scrap price.  The tail is a total loss.  The remainder is very nearly scrap.

# 2/20/2018 - Corvair engine

I picked up this half converted corvair engine.  It needs the 5th bearing added assembled and test run.
