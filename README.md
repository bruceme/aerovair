Homebuilt airplane you can drive home

# The mythical flying-car and the unabtanium affect 
There have been many attempts at making a "flying car", [so many, not worth listing](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=flying+car).  If one does absolutely everything perfectly, you end up with some chitty-chitty-contraotion that's a meager airplane and a poor excuse for an automobile.  So, let's start there with the bar set WAY WAY low.  If you are still reading, it's because you are ok with sacraficing modern automotive conveniance and the last 20% of an aircraft performance just so you can have one vehicle that is capable of parking in your garage, driving you to the nearest public airport so you can go flying.

There are three current "way out there" concept vehicles that have demonstrated this capability.  _BUT_... You won't see them unless you have over $500,000 USD handy _AND_ you're willing to wait 5+ years.  And to be honest, if history is an indicator, the _far_ better odds are on it never being built at any volume ever.

There is a proactive, do-it-yourself, alternative.  Build it!  Anyone can build/fly a homebuilt aircraft or build/drive a kit car right now, today.  So... what's stopping us?  It's a matter of engineering.

# Goals
## Initial
* Can fly up to 900 miles at 150mph
* Can drive up to 5 miles all electric on batteries
* Can run the gasoline motor to regenerate electricity to continue driving 
* Can Convert to and from flying and driving modes in under one minutes. 

## Future
* Clutched propeller so regen can occur without the propellor spinning
* Mode conversion is actuated and you don't have to leave the cockpit
* You can drive up to 600 miles without stopping

# A car that can fly or a plane that can drive?
One has to find a starting point and I like a plane that can drive.  Here's why...

* I purposely prejudice the primary mission as flying, not driving.  Driving is secondary to achieve improved logistics.
* It's much easier to take something lightweight (aircraft) and make it do more stuff (add weight) than the other way around.
* The fundamental engineering requirements of flight are orders of magnatude harder to achieve than the fundamentals of every-day driving.

# Airframe
The choice of homebuilt airframes is somewhat arbitrary, but the initial airframe will begin with a Van's RV-4.  For clarity this cesses to be refered to or associated in any way with a Vans series aircraft.  It will be a unique airframe using components Vans and others will manufacture.  This is similar to the approach Harmon Rocket has taken.

## What is staying the same..
* Empanage
* Fuselage 
* The majority of the wing structure

## What is being altered...
* Engine will be a gasoline-electric hybrid
* Landing gear - The stock engine-mount landing gear will be removed and converted to leaf-spring with linkage for steered main wheels.  The tailwheel will be fixed, large and driven by a modest electric motor.  This will give improved road stability landing/driving handling more like a Can-Am Spyder.  This should stability should lower the tricycle gear instability associated with ground-looping.
* Wing will be modified to support folding.  See folding wing and mode transition.
